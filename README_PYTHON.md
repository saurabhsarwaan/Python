# 🐍 Python Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview  
This project is a **Python-based data analysis notebook** that focuses on cleaning, exploring, and analyzing data to extract meaningful insights.  
The notebook demonstrates how Python can be used for end-to-end data analysis, from raw data to insights and visualizations.

---

## Objectives  

- Load and explore the dataset  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Generate insights using statistics and visualizations  
- Summarize findings  

---

## Tools & Libraries Used  

- **Python 3**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn (optional)** – Modeling (if used)
